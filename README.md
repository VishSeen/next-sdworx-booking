# Tech Employee Dashboard

An app started as a Hackathon project at SDWorx Mauritius. 
The basic funtionality was to implement a seat booking for the over populated employees.
Finally this is going to be built as a full fledged employee dashboard which manages the hybrid work environment for mostly tech companies.
